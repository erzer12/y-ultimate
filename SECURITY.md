# Security Summary

## CodeQL Analysis Results

Date: 2025-10-31
Status: ✅ ACCEPTABLE FOR MVP SCOPE

### Findings

CodeQL identified **7 alerts**, all related to the same category:
- **Rule:** `js/missing-rate-limiting`
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Category:** Denial-of-Service Protection

### Details

All 7 alerts are for authenticated API endpoints that lack rate limiting:
1. `GET /api/reports/attendance` - Report generation endpoint
2. `GET /api/children` - List children endpoint
3. `POST /api/children` - Create child endpoint
4. `GET /api/sessions` - List sessions endpoint
5. `POST /api/children/import` - CSV import endpoint
6. `POST /api/sessions` - Create session endpoint
7. `POST /api/sessions/:id/attendance` - Save attendance endpoint

### Risk Assessment

**For MVP/Hackathon Demo:** ✅ ACCEPTABLE
- Scope explicitly excludes production-hardened configurations
- Demo environment with limited users (admin, manager, coach)
- Protected by JWT authentication
- Local development only (not exposed to internet)

**For Production:** ⚠️ REQUIRES MITIGATION
- Rate limiting should be implemented using middleware like `express-rate-limit`
- Recommended limits:
  - Auth endpoints: 5 requests/minute per IP
  - Data modification: 20 requests/minute per user
  - Report generation: 10 requests/minute per user
  - CSV import: 5 requests/hour per user

### Mitigation Plan (Post-MVP)

When moving to production, implement rate limiting:

```typescript
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';

// Apply to auth routes
const authLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 60 * 1000, // 1 minute
  max: 5, // 5 requests per window
  message: 'Too many login attempts, please try again later'
});

// Apply to data modification routes
const dataLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 60 * 1000, // 1 minute
  max: 20, // 20 requests per window
  message: 'Too many requests, please try again later'
});

app.use('/api/auth', authLimiter);
app.use('/api/children', dataLimiter);
// etc...
```

### Other Security Considerations

✅ **Implemented:**
- JWT authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- Role-based access control (admin, manager, coach)
- CORS middleware configured
- Input validation on required fields
- SQL injection protection via Prisma ORM
- parseInt with radix parameter for type safety

⚠️ **Not Implemented (By Design - MVP Scope):**
- Rate limiting (flagged by CodeQL)
- HTTPS/TLS (local dev only)
- Advanced password policies
- Session management/token refresh
- Audit logging
- IP allowlisting
- CSRF protection
- Content Security Policy

### Conclusion

The security posture is **appropriate for a hackathon MVP demo**. All CodeQL findings are expected and acceptable given the explicit non-production scope. No critical or high-severity vulnerabilities were identified.

For production deployment, implement rate limiting and other production-hardening measures as outlined above.
