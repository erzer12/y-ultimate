# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/erzer12/y-ultimate.git
```

git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

### 3. Set Up Development Environment

Follow the [Setup Guide](SETUP.md) to configure your local environment.

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

#### Backend (Python/FastAPI)
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints for function parameters and returns
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Max line length: 100 characters

```python
def create_session(
    session: SessionCreate,
    db: Session = Depends(get_db)
) -> Session:
    """
    Create a new coaching session.
    
    Args:
        session: Session data to create
        db: Database session dependency
        
    Returns:
        Created session object
    """
    # Implementation
```

#### Frontend (React/JavaScript)
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow Airbnb React style guide
- Use descriptive variable names
- Keep components small and focused
- Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling

```jsx
const ChildProfile = ({ childId }) => {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['child', childId],
    queryFn: () => fetchChildProfile(childId)
  });

  if (isLoading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
  if (error) return <ErrorMessage error={error} />;

  return (
    <div className="p-6 bg-white rounded-2xl shadow-soft">
      {/* Component content */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Commit Messages

Use conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation of what changed and why.

Fixes #123
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**

```

```
fix(frontend): resolve navigation menu overflow on mobile

The mobile navigation menu was cutting off on smaller screens.

```

### Testing

#### Backend Tests
```bash
cd backend
pytest
pytest --cov=app tests/
```

Write tests for:
- All API endpoints
- Business logic functions
- Database models and relationships

Example:
```python
def test_create_child_profile(client, db):
    """Test creating a child profile"""
    response = client.post(
        "/api/v1/profiles/",
        json={
            "name": "John Doe",
            "date_of_birth": "2010-05-15",
            "school": "Test School"
        }
    )
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert response.json()["name"] == "John Doe"
```

#### Frontend Tests
```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```
